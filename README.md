# Nand to Tetris Course Projects

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the [Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. The Nand to Tetris course is a self-paced journey from Boolean algebra to building a general-purpose computer system.

## Projects Overview

The course consists of six main projects:

1. **Project 1 Elementary Logic Gates**
   - Build basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, Multiplexor, and more.

2. **Project 2 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
   - Construct a family of adder chips culminating in building an ALU.

3. **Project 3 Memory Units**
   - Develop registers and memory units, leading to the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM).

4. **Project 4 Machine Language Programming**
   - Learn a machine language and write illustrative low-level programs.

5. **Project 5 Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
   - Utilize the chipset built in Projects 1-3 to create a CPU and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in Project 4.

6. **Project 6 Assembler**
   - Develop an assembler to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary executable code.

Each project builds upon the concepts and skills learned in previous projects, leading to the construction of a fully functional computer system by the end of the course.
